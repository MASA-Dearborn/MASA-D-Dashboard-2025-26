# MASA Rocket Telemetry Dashboard – Codebase Summary

The MASA dashboard is a real-time rocket telemetry system built with a Python backend, Node.js bridge, and React frontend. Data arrives from either an Arduino over Serial USB or a software simulator at 20 Hz. The backend (`main.py`) routes each packet in parallel: one path feeds a data buffer that serves the live dashboard via a Flask API at 10 Hz, while the other path writes every packet directly to SQLite. The buffer implements a thread-safe circular queue using `collections.deque` to decouple the high-frequency (20 Hz) data source from the variable-speed consumer. It uses a `threading.Lock` to serialize access, preventing race conditions and data corruption during simultaneous reads and writes. A fixed maximum size (40 packets) automatically manages memory by discarding the oldest packets when full, preventing overflows during long simulations. A separate recovery buffer holds the last 30 seconds of data and is flushed to disk on shutdown or crash, so the most critical flight data is preserved.

The Node.js server (`server/server.js`) polls the Flask API every 100 ms and broadcasts validated telemetry to React clients over Socket.IO. The React dashboard (`App.js`) displays live stats (altitude, velocity, flight state, packet count, dropped packets), time-series charts for altitude, velocity, acceleration, and gyro axes, and a NavBall attitude indicator that derives pitch from acceleration, integrates roll from gyro data, and shows heading from the magnetometer. Styling uses a dark theme with Orbitron and JetBrains Mono fonts.

The stack is Python 3.14 with Flask, pyserial, and SQLite on the backend; Node.js with Express and Socket.IO for the bridge; and React 19 with Chart.js on the frontend. Startup order is backend → Node server → React; the system runs entirely offline on localhost.
